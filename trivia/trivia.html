        <p style="color:blue">Dear Damilare,</p>
        <p>I hope this <b>letter</b> finds you in good health and high spirits. I wanted to take a moment to share something exciting that's been happening in my life recently. As you know, I've always been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers. To further this passion, I decided to join KodeCamp, a comprehensive coding bootcamp designed to transform my skills and open new doors in the tech world.</p>

        <p>My primary goal in <b>KodeCamp</b> is to become a professional <b>Frontend</b> developer. I want to learn how to build robust, scalable web applications from scratch. This includes mastering <strong>Front-end</strong> technologies like <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>JavaScript</em>, as well as back-end frameworks and databases. The idea of creating something tangible and impactful from lines of code truly excites me.</p>

        <p >Moreover, I aim to develop a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. These skills are crucial for tackling complex challenges and creating efficient solutions, not just in coding but in various aspects of life.</p>

        <p>I believe <b>KodeCamp</b> will also provide me with a great opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and mentors who can guide me on this journey. Networking with professionals in the field is something I am looking forward to, as it will offer valuable insights and potentially lead to collaborative projects in the future.</p>

        <p >Ultimately, my goal is to leverage the skills and knowledge gained from <b>KodeCamp</b> to start a career in software development. I envision myself working on innovative projects that can make a difference and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

        <p>Thank you for always being a source of inspiration and support. I wanted to share this with you because your encouragement means the world to me. I'll keep you updated on my progress and the milestones I achieve along the way.</p>

        <p style="text-align: right">With warm regards,<span style="display: block;">signature</span> damilare</p>

<!--        <li>I chose to use times new roman as my font cause while doing my assignments and project in school, the font seems to be the most appropriate and accepted font for typing</li>-->
<!--        <li>I chose to give the address a right alignment and I justified the body of the letter to give it readability because that's the format for an informal letter.</li>-->
<!--        <li>I decided to make the kodecamp bold by adding strong to it because it's the name of the organization that is hosting this cohort and the same was done for front-end <br>-->
<!--            to show the track I'm currently learning and I also lay emphasis of the html, css, and javascript to let my friend know the exact programing language that i'm learning.</li>-->
<!--        <li>color was added to the address and the greeting to make them stand out from the rest of the text</li>-->
